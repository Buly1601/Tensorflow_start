# Abstract divider
## Introduction
Abstracts are sometimes hard to read when they are not correctly divided, skipping the introduction, methods, ... . Abstract divider gets to know the information and divides the sentences accordingly. Recurrent neural networks are particularly good with sequential problems, problems that involve context to know the answer. For example, this picture:

![ball](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66335475/154822508-2bfb0e2e-5d54-4b66-8132-65aece0826dd.jpg)

Now, if I were to ask you: what is the direction of the first ball (the one on the bottom)? The answer should be inconclusive, there is not enough context to answer the question, actually, the answer to that question comes from another one: where was the ball one second ago? then if we would know that answer, we can identify the ball's path, like the ball that's on top of the static one, the direction is to the right.
